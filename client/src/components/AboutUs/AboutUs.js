                GAFI is an affiliate of the Ministry of Investment (MOI) and the principal government body regulating and facilitating investment in Egypt.<br/>
                Although the authority retains its traditional regulatory powers, GAFI today is an effective, proactive investment promotion agency with promotion, facilitation, business matchmaking, Egyptian expatriates, events, investor aftercare, and research and market intelligence functions.<br/>
                As Egypt's one-stop shop for investment, GAFI eases the way for global investors looking to harness opportunities presented by Egypt's fast-growing domestic economy and the nation's robust competitive advantages as an export hub for Europe, the Arab world and Africa.
