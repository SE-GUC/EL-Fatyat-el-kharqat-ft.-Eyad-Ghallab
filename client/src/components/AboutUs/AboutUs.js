                <br/>
                 GAFI's investor care officers also ensure that client feedback is channeled into government agencies with a view towards continuously enhancing and reforming Egypt's investment climate.<br/> In addition to promoting Egypt's investment opportunities in various sectors, <br/>GAFI is launching new initiatives aimed at promoting the investment climate in Egypt including the adoption of new investment regimes (investment zones and special economic zones) and the establishment of the SME Entrepreneurial Center and Fund (Bedaya).
